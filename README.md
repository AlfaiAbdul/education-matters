### Analysis of College Scorecard Data
<p>Source of data: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/ (US Department of Education)

<p>The primary purpose of these data are to develop score cards (ranking) that can be used to evaluate academic institutions; for example see: https://www.brookings.edu/research/using-earnings-data-to-rank-colleges-a-value-added-approach-updated-with-college-scorecard-data/ 
<p>We chose this data set to explore the following questions/areas:

1. Is there a predictive set of features (eg degree program) that can be used to gauge the earning potential for graduating students?
2. Are there any discernable correlations that relate demographic and economic features to academic performance (eg graduation rate and race)?
3. What, if any, natural groupings can be found in the set of features explored the above questions?
<p>ML usage:

* To address the first two questions, we plan to use regression analysis.
* For the third question, K Means Clustering.
<p>The following tools/techniques will be applied in various areas:

* Pandas for data munging
* Python Matplotlib and Tableau for data visualization
* We may also develop a web site to showcase our project (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap)
